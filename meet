below is the end-to-end plan to introduce an Azure DevOps CICD pipeline for every project the dev team maintains.
The same template will be applied to each repository; only environment names and IIS site names change.

    1. STANDARD PIPELINE STAGES (applies to every project)

    1. Build
• Restore, compile, unit-test, security-scan, package
• Artifact produced: drop-{SemVer}-build.{BuildId}
       
    2. Deploy → IIS-Test (non-production)
• Automatic deployment after every merge to main
• Smoke tests run
       
    3. Manual Approval Gate → IIS-Staging
• CAB group notified by e-mail / mobile app
• Approval window = 4 hours; timeout = reject
       
    4. Deploy → IIS-Production (identical package)
• Zero-downtime blue-green switch via “Take App Offline”
• Post-deployment health-check

    2. APPROVAL WORKFLOW

• Environment “IIS-Staging” has an Approvals & Checks rule:
CAB members = “DevOps-CAB@company.com”
Required votes = 1 out of 3
Escalation after 4 h = automatic reject & alert manager

• Emergency hot-fix path (break-glass):
Tag branch “hotfix/*” → pipeline bypasses staging approval and goes straight to production after manager single-approval via Teams bot.

    3. ROLLBACK PLAN

A. Rollback Trigger
• Health-check fails OR
• > 5 % error rate in 5 min window after prod deploy OR
• Manual rollback request via Teams channel “#prod-rollback”
B. Rollback Steps (≤ 5 min target)
    1. Pipeline “Rollback-{Project}” is triggered automatically or manually
    2. Swaps IIS site back to previous deployment slot (kept warm)
    3. Database: run “Down” migration script stored in repo /scripts/rollback
    4. Notifies CAB & manager via e-mail & Teams
       
C. Rollback Verification
• Same smoke tests executed on rolled-back version
• Ticket created in backlog to fix forward

    4. TIMELINE (per project)

Week 0 – Kick-off & repo inventory (½ day)
Week 1 – Create build stage + unit-test gate (2 days)
Week 1-2 – Set up IIS-Test environment + auto-deploy (3 days)
Week 2 – Create IIS-Staging environment + CAB approvals (2 days incl. CAB training)
Week 3 – Create IIS-Production environment + rollback job (2 days)
Week 3 – Dry-run a dummy release + rollback drill (½ day)
Week 4 – Go-live, monitor first 3 prod releases (buffer 2 days)
Total 7-9 working days per project (parallel tracks possible).

    5. PARALLEL EXECUTION PLAN (across projects)

Week 0 – Identify 6 active projects
Week 1 – Build stage for all 6 (shared template)
Week 2 – IIS-Test for 3 projects, build stage for the other 3
Week 3 – IIS-Staging for first 3, IIS-Test for second 3
Week 4 – IIS-Production for first 3, IIS-Staging for second 3
Week 5 – Complete second 3 → all 6 live

    6. RISKS & MITIGATIONS

• CAB overload → stagger go-lives, rotate reviewers
• Rollback script missing → each team must supply before Week 3
• Secret leaks → migrate to Azure Key Vault + variable groups
Please let me know if you’d like a Gantt chart or budget estimate.

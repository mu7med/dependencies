Concerns Raised During the Meeting

1. Server Specifications

Server resources depend on the anticipated data volume.

If the data size increases, corresponding server specifications (CPU, memory, storage) will need to be scaled up.



2. Staging Environment

Discussion on whether a separate staging environment is required before production deployment.



3. Network Zoning and Connectivity

Clarification is needed on maintaining separate zones and network connectivity between Production and Staging servers.



4. Oracle Server Licensing

Licensing requirements and availability for Oracle servers need to be confirmed.



5. Replication Method

The replication strategy (e.g., Oracle GoldenGate) must be clarified.

The Enterprise Architecture (EA) team will study the proposed replication plan.



6. Project Timeline

The proposed timeline requires further review and discussion to ensure feasibility.



7. Documentation Requirements

All required technical and infrastructure specification documents must be completed after final confirmation of requirements.
